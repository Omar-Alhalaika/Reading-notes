# How to use objects and methods

## This one line of JavaScript shows how to use objects and methods.
## programmers refer to this as  `calling` a method of an onject.

` document.write('Good afternoon');`
* `document` is the object
* `write('Good afternoon')` is the method 

# JAVASCRIPT RUNS WHERE IT IS FOUND IN THE HTML

## When the browser comes across a <script> element, it stops to load the script and then checks to see if it needs to do anything. 


`<script src="j s/ add-content .j s "></script> `
* Note how the `<script>` element can be moved
below the first paragraph, and this affects where
the new greeting is written into the page. 
* This has implications for where `<scri pt>` elements
should be placed, and can affect the loading time of
pages 

# Summary:

## How do I write a script for a web pages!

* It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension. 

* The HTML `<script>` element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
the `<link>` element can be used to load a CSS file). 

* If you view the source code of the page in the browser,
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,
because the script works with the model of the web
page that the browser has created. 

* THE LANGUAGE:
SYNTAX AND GRAMMAR
like any new language, there are new
words to learn (the vocabulary) and rules
for how these can be put together (the
grammar and syntax of the language).

* GIVING INSTRUCTIONS:
FOR A BROWSER TO FOLLOW
Web browsers (and computers in general)
approach tasks in a very different way than
a human might. Your instructions need to
reflect how computers get things done.

## STATEMENTS

### A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon. 

## COMMENTS 

### You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code. 

## VARIABLE

### A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables. 

### A variable is a good name for this concept because the data stored in a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs. 

## DATA TYPES

### NUMERIC DATA TYPE
The numeric data type handles
numbers. 
### STRING DATA TYPE
The strings data type consists of
letters and other characters.
### BOOLEAN DATA TYPE
Boolean data types can have one
of two values: true or false.



# RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES

* The name must begin with
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_). It must not start
with a number. 


* The name can contain letters,
numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or a
period (.) in a variable name.


* You cannot use keywords or
reserved words. Keywords
are special words that tell the
interpreter to do something. For
example, var is a keyword used
to declare a variable. Reserved
words are ones that may be used
in a future version of JavaScript.

reserved words in JavaScript.


* All variables are case sensitive,
so score and Score would be
different variable names, but
it is bad practice to create two
variables that have the same
name using different cases. 


* Use a name that describes the
kind of information that the
variable stores. For example,
fi rstName might be used to
store a person's first name,
l astNarne for their last name,
and age for their age.


* If your variable name is made
up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word.
For example, f i rstName rather
than fi rstnarne (this is referred
to as camel case). You can also
use an underscore between each
word (you cannot use a dash).
