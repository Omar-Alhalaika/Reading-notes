## `We are here to talk about our mindset and how it can affect us`

In term of mindset, we are talking about the way we are looking to the world, and our responses to whatever is happening around us.
so if we want to reach our goals, living our dreams, or enjoying our lives we need to adopt a ***Growth Mindset***
and as Stephen Curry said:
> Success is not an accident, success is a choice.
 so we are adopting this kind of mindset!

So a `Growth Mindset`it is how we:
* -[x] *Embrace* the challenge; not ~avoiding~ them

* -[x] *Persists* the obestcles; not ~losing focus~ 

* -[x] putting more *Effort* and know it will come eventully; not being ~fruitless~ 

* -[x] *Learn & modify our behavior* when we hear criticism; not ~Ignoring~ them

And for sure being ispired by others and how they make it and support however needs support.

## `Be Kind and Supportive`
