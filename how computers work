# Computers
##  A computer works combining input, storage, processing, and output. All the main parts of a computer system are involved in one of these four processes.

* The computer does its primary work in a part of the machine we cannot see, a control center that converts data input to information output.
 This control center, called the central processing unit (CPU), 
 is a highly complex, extensive set of electronic circuitry that executes stored program instructions. All computers, large and small, must have a central processing unit.
 
 * on a very fundamental level all a computer understands is 1’s and 0’s which means that every single input and output gets at some point translated into or from 1’s and 0s.
 * On a very basic and oversimplified level, we can use electrical circuits to behave as “logical machines”. We can have circuits that, given a specific input,
 will return an output depending on the logic with which they’ve been built (Not, And, Or) but also sums, subtractions, multiplications, and divisions.
