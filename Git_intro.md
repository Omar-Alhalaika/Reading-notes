# Sweet Git

## `We are here to talk about Git!`

Git is an open-source, version control tool created in 2005 by developers working on the Linux operating system;
and Git is a VCS — Version Control System. What that really means is, Git helps us manage our project files. One of the primary things that git does and also the primary reason it exists is to keep track of the entire history of things that you are working on.

>Some Basic Terminology
Repository: A Git Repository, or a repo, is a folder that you’ve told Git to help you track file changes.
Branch: A branch is an independent line of development. You can think of it as a brand new working directory.
Fork: A fork is a personal copy of another user’s repository that lives on your account.
Clone: A clone is simply a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a server.
Commit: A commit is a set of one or more changes to a file(or a set of files). Every time you save, it creates a unique ID(“hash”) which helps it keep track of the history.
Master: The default development branch. Whenever you create a git repo, a branch named “master” is created which becomes the default active branch.

History of Git
Git traces its roots to the open source software project Linux kernel. Developers of this project began using a DVCS called BitKeeper in 2002. In 2005, many of these developers stopped using this DVCS due to tension between the Linux kernel community and the company behind BitKeeper’s and the eventual revocation of the DVCS’ gratis status. Subsequently, Linus Torvalds, the chief architect of the Linux kernel, began creating Git. With the intention of creating a DVCS with a workflow design similar to that of BitKeeper, which was also fast, Git allowed for non-linear development via multiple branches, could support large projects, possessed strong mechanisms preventing corruption, and had a simple design. Since its inception in 2005, Git has become one of the most utilized Version Control Systems in the world.
